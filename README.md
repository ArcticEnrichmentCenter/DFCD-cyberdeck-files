build instructions come here:

Upper frame assembly starts with inserting linear bearings in chassis.

The screen release switch is mounted, a spring not shown here must be sourced from a ballpen.

Completed upper frame

Bottom chasssis haves must be welded togheter with a soldering iron. ventilation frames and mounting points for rails is inserted.

Rails carriying power and usb signals must be wired up and assembled to bottom chassis.

then upper and lower chassis are stacked and screwed down.

Side rails are assembled

Then screen assembly begins. the base must be welded together with soldering iron, and placed over chassis. Then guiderods are installed, locking the base down.

The completed base with sliding mechanism lets us continue assembly to screen:
