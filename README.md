This is the DesignatedFreeCadDevice, a moduar cyberdeck primarily designed to run FreeCad.

**what does it do?**
It runs freecad of course :) i developed it mostly to be able to open and modify CAD files while in the workshop, but i also use it to browse the web and genral computing. It has a keyboard hidden under the sliden screen, as i rarley use a keyboard, but i did want to have a full depth mechanical keyboard whenever i actually use one. The machine is modular so that one can build modules that fits your personal needs. I hope people migth feel inspired to make their own modules.

**How is the modules powered?**
Cables run on the backside, transfering USB betweeen the modules.

**overview of the device**
The cyberdeck consist of a central core where one can attach both modules that works as input devices and modules that deliver power to the device.

The modules are connected with power and signals to the bottom rails.

On the left side you can find ports to connect to external devices, and a handle for scrolling both verticaly, and horizontally.

On the rigth side we find a the trackball module, and the power module. the powermodule accept NP-F batteries, and send the 7.2 volts to the chassis, where it is converted to 5.1 volts for the rasberry pi.

On the forward facing modules you find mounting points for a shoulder strap. On the rear of the central unit you find the lever for releasing the sliding screen,

**What is the current status on this project?**
Screen is working, keyboad types and trackball rolls. what i have not done yet is to wire up the scrolling handle and connection module on the left. The trackball electronics is currently 
harvested from a logiteck trackball marble, meaning you need to source one to build one of these, wich is not optimal. so i want to build my own trackball electronics in the future.
